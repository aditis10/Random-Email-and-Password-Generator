## Random Email and Password Generator

### Description

This program generates random emails and passwords for anyone who needs it. It is a basic program using Java and object oriented programming. The main purpose of this program was to learn how OOP works and how to use it to accomplish something. 

### Issues and Challenges

Some issues that I came up with while making this project is figuring out errors in my methods. For instance, sometimes I would not return the correct data type mentioned in the method and the program would not run. To solve this, I created local variables inside the method with the same data type as the method and returned that at the end. 

### Future plans

I plan on publishing this project on a website soon, which will enhance my knowledge of databases and web development. I plan on using MySQL and JavaScript for this purpose.

I added my own ideas onto this project after following the tutorial.
